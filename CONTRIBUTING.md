# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Video Analysis Pipeline! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of video processing concepts

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/video-analysis-pipeline.git
   cd video-analysis-pipeline
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

## Branch Strategy

We follow a structured branching strategy:

- `master`: Production-ready code
- `development`: Main development branch
- `feature/feature-name`: New features
- `bugfix/issue-description`: Bug fixes

### Creating a Branch
```bash
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write descriptive docstrings
- Keep functions focused and small

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add batch processing for multiple videos"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in frame extraction"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```

### Code Review Process
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Create a pull request to `development`
4. Address review feedback
5. Merge after approval
