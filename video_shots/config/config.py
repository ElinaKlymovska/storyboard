# Keyframe analysis settings
DEFAULT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are assisting an editor who prepares the Keyframes table. Analyze the provided video frame and return ONLY valid JSON with the following structure:

  "scene_id": "scene_01",
  "shot_id": "shot_01",
  "kf_index": 1,
  "timecode": "HH:MM:SS.mmm",
  "thumb_url": "",
  "action_note": "Brief description of what happens in this exact moment",
  "dialogue_or_vo": "Spoken line or voice-over at this moment, or empty string",
  "transition_in_out": {
    "in": "cut",
    "out": "cut"
  },
  "status": "draft",
  "notes": "Any additional editorial notes (can be empty)"
}

Guidelines:
- scene_id and shot_id must be concise snake_case identifiers (use placeholders if unsure).
- timecode must be formatted exactly as HH:MM:SS.mmm and align with the observed moment.
- transition values must be one of: cut, fade, crossfade, glitch, wipe, other.
- status must be either draft or approved (default to draft if uncertain).
- thumb_url can be left blank; pipeline will fill it later.
- If information is unknown, provide an empty string but keep the key.

Return ONLY the JSON object, without extra commentary or markdown."""

# Video shot analysis settings (~5 second intervals)
SHOT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You analyze a 5-second shot segment to populate the Storyboard table. Return ONLY valid JSON:

  "audio": "VO/dialogue/SFX/music summary or empty string",
  "transition_out": "cut",
  "status": "draft"
}

Rules:
- Use the enumerations: shot_type in {WS, MS, CU, ECU, POV, OTS, Macro}; transition_out in {cut, fade, crossfade, glitch, wipe, match_cut, other}; status in {draft, approved} (default draft).
- timecodes must use HH:MM:SS.mmm format and be consistent (end_tc >= start_tc).
- Provide concise but informative text; keep audio empty if nothing notable.
- scene_id/shot_id must stay consistent with Keyframes output when known; otherwise invent stable placeholders.

Return ONLY the JSON object with no extra commentary."""
